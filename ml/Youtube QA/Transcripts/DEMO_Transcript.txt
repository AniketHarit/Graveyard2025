[00:00] "Living in the depths of the oceans"
[00:01] "these deep sea creatures"
[00:02] "why are we seeing more of them?"
[00:07] "This scary looking fish"
[00:09] "is called the Sea Devil."
[00:10] "It carries a torch on its head,"
[00:13] "using it to lure a prey into its mouth."
[00:15] "There's a centuries old Japanese belief"
[00:17] "that appearance of an oarfish above water"
[00:19] "is a sign of a disaster."
[00:23] "During World War 2,"
[00:25] "sonar operators of the navy"
[00:26] "were shocked to see a false sea floor."
[00:28] "Millions and billions of fish,"
[00:29] "were swimming out of the deep sea"
[00:31] "towards the surface."
[00:35] Hello, friends!
[00:36] Let's talk about January 2023.
[00:38] In Japan, a fisherman
[00:39] went out in his boat for fishing.
[00:41] Somewhere in the middle of the sea,
he threw the fishing net into the water.
[00:45] After a while, when he was retrieving
the fish trapped in his net,
[00:49] he found a strange, long fish.
[00:53] This fish was extremely long.
[00:55] Like a snake.
[00:57] Its length was later measured
to be almost 6 meters.
[01:00] Its body was sticky and white like rubber.
[01:03] This wasn't a normal fish.
[01:04] It came from the deep sea.
[01:06] It was a Deep Sea Oarfish.
[01:11] Usually, they are found deep in the sea,
[01:13] around 1 km below the surface level.
[01:15] This fisherman released
it back into the sea
[01:18] because according to Japanese legends
[01:20] spotting an oarfish
is a sign of a disaster.
[01:23] Especially earthquakes.
[01:25] In 2011, Japan was struck
by a devastating earthquake
[01:28] and just before that earthquake
[01:30] dead bodies of about 20 oarfish
[01:32] were found on the Japanese coast.
[01:34] But today, these stories
are being questioned,
[01:36] because not only in Japan,
[01:37] but in the last few years,
[01:39] in many places across the world,
[01:41] dead bodies of oarfish have
washed up on sea shores.
[01:44] In 2023, a fisherman
[01:46] caught 50 oarfish in one go.
[01:49] In 2024, in California,
oarfish was spotted thrice.
[01:52] in February 2025,
[01:53] a live oarfish was
spotted in Mexico.
[01:56] "What are you doing?"
[01:58] "That's an oarfish."
[02:01] These fishes being spotted so frequently
[02:03] is extremely surprising
[02:06] because until a few years ago,
[02:07] spotting oarfish used to be rare.
[02:10] It was only in 2001,
that for the first time,
[02:13] a live oarfish was filmed.
[02:15] But it's not just about oarfish.
[02:17] Many such deep sea creatures
[02:21] are suddenly being spotted at
surface level quite frequently.
[02:23] Giant Phantom Jellyfish
[02:25] is an amazing creature
[02:27] with ribbon-like tentacles
longer than 10 meters.
[02:31] They are usually found 1-2 km
deep in the ocean,
[02:35] but in Antarctica,
[02:36] they were spotted at the
depth of merely 80 meters.
[02:38] There were two other such incidents.
[02:40] In Russia, fishermen caught a creature
[02:43] that was believed to be an alien.
[02:45] It was a Smooth Lumpfish,
[02:47] its body looks like a brain.
[02:50] Apart from this, about 2,000 meters
away from the Spanish coast,
[02:52] a Black Sea Devil Anglerfish
was spotted at the surface level.
[02:57] This scary looking fish
is called the Sea Devil.
[03:00] Once again, these two types
of fish are deep sea creatures
[03:03] which have almost never
been spotted at the surface level.
[03:05] So obviously, the question arises,
[03:08] what is happening?
[03:09] These deep sea creatures
[03:10] humans didn't even know about
them for thousands of years,
[03:13] why are they suddenly
coming up to the surface now?
[03:16] Come, in this video, let's try to
understand this topic properly.
[03:31] Friends, before we start with this video,
I would like to tell you
[03:33] about my new live workshop,
[03:36] the AI Masterclass.
[03:38] A 2.5-hour long online masterclass,
[03:40] where I'd be live personally,
[03:42] to teach you how to
use 20 different AI tools.
[03:45] ChatGPT, DeepSeek,
[03:47] Midjourney, Leonardo AI,
[03:48] Dream Studio, Runway ML,
[03:50] and many new Chinese AI
[03:52] that you might not have even heard about,
[03:53] like Hailu AI,
[03:54] Kling AI.
[03:55] We will talk about image generation,
[03:57] video generation,
[03:58] and even website generation,
[04:01] through Artificial Intelligence software.
[04:03] This is a great and affordable opportunity
[04:05] to upskill yourself in AI,
[04:07] because it costs as
little as 2 movie tickets.
[04:10] But since this is
a live workshop,
[04:12] only a limited number
of people can attend it.
[04:14] So if you are interested, act fast!
[04:17] You can use the link given in the
pinned comment or in the description
[04:19] or you can scan this QR code.
[04:22] The exact date and time of the
workshop is mentioned in this link.
[04:25] Now let's get back to our topic.
[04:27] About 71% of the Earth's surface
[04:30] is covered with water.
[04:34] We have classified this
water mass as different oceans.
[04:37] 97% of the water on earth
[04:40] is in the 5 main oceans.
[04:41] Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean,
[04:43] Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean,
[04:45] and the Southern Ocean.
[04:46] 94% of the world's wildlife
[04:48] is found in these oceans.
[04:50] But do you know what,
[04:51] humans have explored and
mapped only 5% of the oceans.
[04:57] The remaining 95%
[04:59] especially the deep sea,
[05:00] still remains a mystery.
[05:02] Surprisingly,
[05:03] we have better maps of Mars
[05:06] than the ocean floor
of the planet we live on.
[05:08] Also, 12 astronauts,
[05:09] have spent a total of
300 hours on the moon,
[05:12] but only 3 people, and only for 3 hours,
[05:15] were able to go to the deepest
point of the sea, Challenger Deep.
[05:19] When you're at a beach in Goa,
[05:21] and look at the blue water,
[05:22] you can see only the
topmost layer of the ocean.
[05:26] This is called
the Sunlight Zone,
[05:27] the depth to which sunlight can reach.
[05:30] In this area, the oceanic wildlife
is the most colourful and diverse.
[05:34] This is the only layer of the sea
[05:36] where photosynthesis is possible.
[05:39] That is why macro algae
and phytoplankton are found here.
[05:42] These two living beings are
the basis of the oceanic food chain.
[05:45] Apart from this, in this zone,
[05:47] are most of the things we
associate with the ocean.
[05:50] Whales, sharks, turtles, and dolphins.
[05:53] But as we go deeper,
[05:55] it starts getting darker.
[05:57] The water absorbs sunlight.
[05:59] At the depth of 10 meters,
[06:00] only 16% of the sunlight remains.
[06:03] And by 100 meters,
[06:05] only 1% of the sunlight remains.
[06:07] And if we go deeper still,
[06:08] light cannot reach beyond
the depth of 1,000 meters.
[06:11] This is why it's difficult for humans
to see beyond this depth of the ocean.
[06:16] But after the sunlight zone,
[06:17] at the depth of 200 meters,
begins the next zone,
[06:20] called the Twilight Zone.
[06:22] As you know, sunlight
encompasses all colours.
[06:24] It is a spectrum of colours.
[06:26] Red has the longest wavelength
[06:28] and blue and violet have the shortest.
[06:29] Water absorbs the longer wavelengths first.
[06:33] That's why red is the first to disappear.
[06:35] Then orange, yellow, green,
[06:37] and finally blue and violet.
[06:39] Only blue and violet light
reaches the twilight zone.
[06:42] All other colours disappear by then.
[06:45] And within this zone,
[06:46] we start seeing the weird creatures.
[06:48] Like this Strawberry Squid.
[06:50] This squid looks quite like a strawberry.
[06:53] One of its eyes is bigger than the other.
[06:56] The bigger eye helps it see into the
water at higher levels that get light,
[06:59] and the smaller eye helps it
see bioluminescence in the dark.
[07:02] This squid looks red to us because
[07:04] we see it when it's at shallower depths,
[07:06] in full spectrum light.
[07:08] But if you look at it in the
twilight zone where it lives,
[07:11] it will look almost black.
[07:13] Because the colour red doesn't reach there.
[07:14] Its colour acts as a
camouflage in its environment.
[07:18] If you go a bit deeper
down the twilight zone,
[07:21] you will find Bloody-Belly Comb Jelly.
[07:23] Once again, this looks
to be a fluorescent red.
[07:26] In the deep seas, most creatures
cannot see the colour red.
[07:29] So, to camouflage themselves,
[07:31] they are red in colour.
[07:32] When this jellyfish moves,
[07:34] colourful lights flicker on its body.
[07:37] It looks like 8 rows of rainbows
moving through the water.
[07:43] Now, you might be wondering,
[07:45] since light cannot reach
this deep in the water,
[07:47] how do these lights flicker?
[07:48] This is because of an interesting process
[07:51] called Bioluminescence.
[07:53] Through Bioluminescence,
[07:55] living beings emit light.
[07:57] This is due to two special chemicals.
[07:59] Luciferin and Luciferase.
[08:01] When these two chemicals come together,
[08:03] there's a chemical reaction.
[08:05] And the energy emitted by this reaction
[08:07] is emitted as light instead of heat.
[08:11] These deep sea creatures use this light
[08:14] either to hide themselves
[08:15] or to attract other creatures
[08:17] or to communicate with each other.
[08:20] Like, look at this beautiful creature.
[08:23] It looks like a water fairy.
[08:25] It's called Sea Angel.
[08:27] It's smaller than a human finger
[08:30] and in the dark, its empty stomach glows.
[08:32] It's completely blind,
[08:34] but this sea angel,
[08:35] can turn into a devil within a few seconds.
[08:38] Its quick tentacles help it form a trap,
[08:41] which is impossible to escape.
[08:44] As soon as the prey reaches its stomach,
[08:46] it stops glowing.
[08:48] At the depth of 600-800 meters,
[08:50] is the Barreleye Fish.
[08:51] Another fascinating fish.
[08:53] Its head is transparent
and looks like a dome.
[08:56] Look at it carefully.
[08:57] No other fish resembles
it even in the slightest.
[09:00] Looking at it, you will find that
[09:02] its eyes must be the
black dots above its nose.
[09:05] But actually, these
green bulbs are its eyes.
[09:08] It's interesting that
[09:09] these eyes can only see upwards.
[09:11] So how does it track its food?
[09:15] Scientists theorise that
[09:16] it can somehow rotate its eyes.
[09:19] This feature feels like
an alien technology.
[09:23] A living submarine with a transparent dome
[09:25] with a 360° rotating periscope.
[09:28] If you go deeper into the ocean,
[09:30] you will find this terrifying giant squid.
[09:37] These squids are 13 meters long,
[09:39] equivalent to a two-storey house.
[09:41] The diameter of its eyes is 25-30 cm,
[09:44] the size of a basketball.
[09:46] These are the largest eyes
of any living beings on Earth.
[09:49] Adapted to find its
prey in the dark waters.
[09:52] Come, let's go deeper.
[09:54] After crossing 1,000 meters,
[09:56] the twilight zone ends
[09:58] and the midnight zone begins.
[10:00] Here, sunlight doesn't reach at all.
[10:03] The creatures which live here
[10:04] often move about between the
twilight zone and the midnight zone.
[10:08] Like the deep sea Anglerfishes.
[10:11] Including the Black Sea Devil.
[10:13] The Anglerfish was first
popularised in the film Finding Nemo.
[10:17] You might recall this animation.
[10:19] These fish have a
fishing pole on their head,
[10:21] with a shiny bulb.
[10:23] They use this bulb
[10:25] to attract their prey in the dark waters.
[10:28] This was shown in the film as well.
[10:30] But the thing that wasn't shown in the film
[10:32] and one of the weirdest
fact about angler fish,
[10:35] is its reproduction strategy.
[10:37] The male fish are one-tenth
the size of the female fish.
[10:41] And their only reason for existence
[10:43] is to reproduce.
[10:44] Once they find a female,
[10:46] they become one with her.
[10:48] And "becoming one" actually
means merging with her body.
[10:52] They start sharing the same blood.
[10:54] And in a way,
[10:56] they become an organ of the female's body.
[10:58] The females collect multiple
partners to reproduce.
[11:01] About 6-8 males can be
found attached to a female body.
[11:05] All of this would have given you an idea
[11:07] the deep sea is vastly
different from life on land.
[11:12] Similarly, we have this Vampire Squid.
[11:18] This is the last remaining
species of its order.
[11:20] All its relatives died
200 million years ago.
[11:24] Now remain as fossils.
[11:26] Its eight legs are connected to
each other by a cloak-like webbing.
[11:29] When they are stretched out,
[11:31] it looks like a vampire's cape.
[11:33] For many years, scientists assumed that
[11:35] vampire squid would
be a dangerous predator.
[11:38] But in reality, it is not a blood sucker.
[11:39] In fact, it eats poop.
[11:41] So, even though vampire
squid got a cool name,
[11:43] but it doesn't accurately
reflect its behaviour.
[11:48] Let's go further down in the depths.
[11:51] At the depth of 2,000-3,000m,
[11:53] there is a farmer who grows its own food.
[11:56] This is a Yeti crab.
[11:58] This Yeti actually exists.
[12:01] Its nickname is Yeti because
[12:03] the fur covering its arms
[12:05] reminds us of a Yeti.
[12:07] But if you want to know the truth
of the Yeti from the Himalayas,
[12:11] I have discussed it in this video.
[12:12] But this Yeti crab is blind.
[12:15] Its fur is actually bacterial colonies.
[12:18] It farms bacteria on its hairy arms
[12:21] and then eats those bacteria.
[12:23] And here, specifically,
[12:24] we are talking about
sulphide oxidising bacteria,
[12:27] which grow on it
[12:28] because it lives near hydrothermal vents.
[12:31] If we go further down,
[12:32] at the depth of 4,000 meters,
[12:34] the Midnight Zone ends
[12:35] and the Abyssal Zone begins.
[12:37] It continues till 6,000 meters
below the surface level,
[12:39] and this zone is still vastly unexplored.
[12:42] The creatures found here aren't
found anywhere else on Earth.
[12:46] The Titanic's wreck
is present in this zone,
[12:48] around the depth of about 3,810 meters.
[12:51] Some creatures living at this
depth have been discovered.
[12:55] Like this Dumbo Octopus.
[12:57] It's named so because
of its big ear-like fins
[13:00] because it reminds us of
Disney's flying elephant Dumbo.
[13:03] At no point does it
migrate to the levels above,
[13:06] instead, it spends
its life in the deep sea.
[13:09] These Dumbo Octopuses are possibly
the cutest animals in the deep sea.
[13:13] They swim gracefully and slowly
[13:16] drawing descriptions like
the 'deep sea ballerinas.'
[13:20] Most of the seafloor
[13:22] is at a depth of 6,000m
[13:24] but at some places
[13:25] the sea is deeper than this.
[13:27] At such places,
[13:28] we call the depth of 6,000m to 11,000m
[13:31] as the Hadal zone.
[13:33] This is the deepest part of the oceans
[13:36] and is still full of mysteries.
[13:37] We can talk about
this in another video.
[13:40] For now, let's stick to the main topic.
[13:42] Why are these deep sea creatures coming up?
[13:46] During World War II,
[13:47] some sonar operators of the navy
discovered something interesting.
[13:51] They saw that at night,
[13:53] the entire sea floor
[13:54] rises up hundreds of meters.
[13:57] This was discovered using sonar.
[13:59] However, the sea floor
wasn't actually rising above.
[14:01] Instead, in a large number
of fishes, squids, and plankton
[14:05] were swimming upwards.
[14:07] This unique event is now
called the Deep Scattering Layer.
[14:11] This was the first clue to the
hidden highways of the sea,
[14:13] visited by millions of
marine creatures every day.
[14:19] The deep scattering
layer is that part of the sea
[14:22] which reflects sound.
[14:23] It reflects sound because
[14:25] of the high density of marine life.
[14:29] Scientists have
found that every day,
[14:31] millions and billions of
creatures ranging from
[14:33] small zooplankton to medium-sized fish,
[14:35] swim to the surface level,
[14:37] and then back to the depths.
[14:39] This is said to be the
largest migration on Earth.
[14:42] And the surprising thing is that
[14:43] this has been happening for
centuries, hidden from human eyes.
[14:47] Imagine, billions of animals,
[14:49] that weigh 25 times more
than the total mass of humanity,
[14:52] swim up and then down,
all at once, every single day.
[14:54] This upwards and
downwards migration
[14:56] is called the Diel
Vertical Migration.
[14:59] DVM.
[14:59] This migration happens daily.
[15:02] Every night.
[15:04] You can see this
graph of the migration.
[15:06] During the day,
[15:08] this yellow part
[15:10] is at a depth of 400
meters in the ocean.
[15:12] But at night, this yellow part
[15:14] moves up to the surface.
[15:17] This isn't limited to
only a few places.
[15:19] It happens everywhere.
[15:20] From the Pacific Ocean
to the Indian Ocean.
[15:22] From the North Atlantic
Ocean to the Southern Ocean.
[15:25] So the question is
[15:26] why do all these creature undertake
such a difficult journey every night?
[15:30] The simple answer is 'to
eat without being eaten.'
[15:33] In simpler words,
[15:34] they do this to feed.
[15:36] Since photosynthesis
happens only at the surface,
[15:38] phytoplankton is
found at the surface.
[15:41] Many small fishes and zooplankton
feed on this phytoplankton.
[15:46] You might ask, why don't
they eat during the day?
[15:50] Because they are in the danger
of being eaten during the day.
[15:54] There are other predators,
[15:55] creatures like sharks,
whales, and dolphins,
[15:57] might eat them.
[15:58] That's why these small
fishes and deep sea creatures
[16:01] swim to the surface at night.
[16:02] They feed in the dark
[16:04] and before daybreak,
[16:06] they disappear back
into the depths of the sea.
[16:08] Here, the problem is that
[16:09] this has been changing
over the past few years.
[16:11] Due to climate change,
[16:13] instead of this daily migration,
[16:15] they're migrating permanently.
[16:17] With the earth getting warmer,
[16:19] these deep sea creatures
[16:20] are moving towards
colder places like the poles.
[16:24] You'd already know that
[16:25] the heat generated
by global warming
[16:27] is mostly being
absorbed by our oceans.
[16:31] 90% of the heat is
absorbed by the oceans.
[16:34] And with time,
[16:35] as this heat is
absorbed by the water,
[16:38] the oceans keep getting hotter.
[16:40] The temperatures that were stable for
[16:42] hundreds of thousands
of years are now rising.
[16:44] So what's happening here is that
[16:46] the heat from the sun is
warming up water at the surface.
[16:48] But the water in the
deep sea remains cold.
[16:50] At the same
temperature as before.
[16:52] Because the sun's
heat can't reach there.
[16:54] Warm water is
lighter than cold water.
[16:57] It is less dense.
[16:58] That's why it's
closer to the surface.
[17:00] And the cold water
remains at the bottom.
[17:02] These two waters
cannot mix easily.
[17:05] Consequently, the oxygen
in the water at the surface
[17:08] cannot get to the cold
water at the bottom.
[17:11] There is a shortage of
oxygen in the deep sea.
[17:14] Even a slight shortage
of oxygen means that
[17:16] the population there will
decline on a large scale.
[17:19] This gives rise to the
threat of extinction.
[17:21] And these deep sea creatures
[17:23] have evolved in stable
oxygen environments.
[17:26] So in their search for oxygen, they
are migrating towards the surface.
[17:29] They are moving from the
deep sea to surface water.
[17:31] This is dangerous for them
[17:33] because they have not
evolved to live in surface water.
[17:36] During the day, they will easily
become prey to sharks and whales.
[17:40] Scientists predict that
by the end of this century,
[17:43] the temperature
of the Abyssal zone
[17:45] will increase by 1° Celsius.
[17:47] And deep sea creatures,
[17:48] compared to those
living near the surface,
[17:50] will migrate 4 to
11 times faster.
[17:53] The future of these amazing
creatures is now in danger
[17:57] and many such creatures
[17:58] can be extinct forever.
[18:02] The shocking part is that
[18:04] many of these creatures
haven't even been discovered yet.
[18:06] Every year, new animals are
discovered in the deep sea.
[18:10] Such creatures can now be
extinct because of humans,
[18:13] about which we don't even know.
[18:15] And it's not just
about these creatures.
[18:16] Our lives are also
connected to the deep sea.
[18:19] The deep sea stores
large quantities of carbon.
[18:22] Phytoplankton
actually works as trees.
[18:26] They absorb carbon
[18:28] and store it among
themselves in the deep sea.
[18:30] This regulates the carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere.
[18:33] But due to the changes
caused by climate change,
[18:36] the carbon dioxide absorbing
capacity of the oceans is decreasing.
[18:48] However, climate change
is still a long-term threat.
[18:51] In the short term, there's another
pressing threat to these deep sea creatures
[18:55] caused by humans.
[18:56] This threat is Deep Sea Mining.
[18:59] Look at this Scaly-Foot Snail.
[19:01] Its legs are made of iron.
[19:02] It lives on the deep sea floor
near the hydrothermal vents.
[19:06] It is a small creature
with a big heart.
[19:08] Its heart is 4% of
its body volume,
[19:11] in the entire animal kingdom,
[19:13] this creature has the biggest
heart compared to its body.
[19:16] If humans had such big hearts,
[19:18] it would've been
as big as our heads.
[19:20] It has been living near
the hydrothermal vents
[19:22] on the seafloor for millions of years.
[19:24] But some crony capitalists
are trying to kill this off.
[19:28] Till now, this snail has
been found at three places.
[19:30] But mining companies are trying
to get their hands on these places.
[19:33] They want to mine for gold and
silver near these hydrothermal vents.
[19:38] Some people want to earn money
by sending large machines there,
[19:42] to dig in the deep seas,
[19:45] causing large-scale
destruction of this ecosystem.
[19:53] Here, I won't hesitate
to say that there are
[19:54] some useless politicians
like Donald Trump,
[19:56] who are a burden
for the entire planet.
[19:58] Such politicians brainwash
their followers repeatedly
[20:01] by saying that there is no
such thing as climate change.
[20:11] And on the other hand, to
help their crony capitalist friends,
[20:14] they promote things
like deep sea mining.
[20:18] Narendra Modi is also like this.
[20:19] When he needs
animals for his PR,
[20:22] he will go to the
Ambani's private zoo
[20:25] to habe a photo shoot.
[20:26] But when it comes to
actually saving animals,
[20:29] when it comes to actually protecting
the biodiversity of our country,
[20:33] he will let keep quiet
and let jungles be cut
[20:36] and allow the death of animals.
[20:37] There are many examples of this.
[20:39] Whether it's the Hasdeo jungles,
[20:40] which is being chopped
down to allow mining
[20:42] or the Nicobar island.
[20:44] To help their crony
capitalist friends,
[20:46] they are willing to
allow deep sea mining.
[20:48] I'm not kidding,
look at this article.
[20:50] The Modi government is planning to
permit deep sea mining near Kerala.
[20:54] Many people are protesting
against this in Kerala.
[20:57] This will be disastrous
not only for the animals and
[20:59] the environment, but also
for the locals living there.
[21:04] Their crony capitalist friends have
already poisoned our rivers and our soil.
[21:09] Let's leave the
deep sea as it is.
[21:10] Now some people will
criticise me for talking
[21:13] about politics in a
scientific educational topic.
[21:15] To you all I have to say is
[21:17] haven't you understood this yet?
[21:18] Whether it's science,
environment, or economics,
[21:20] everything is
linked to politics.
[21:22] Because of these
useless politicians,
[21:24] the middle class is dying because
they want to benefit their friends.
[21:28] And because of these
useless politicians,
[21:30] our remaining natural
environment will be destroyed.
[21:32] Because they think
about their friends, not you.
[21:36] Friends, deep sea
mining is something that
[21:38] hasn't been done
anywhere in the world.
[21:40] But these greedy
politicians all across the world
[21:42] and their crony
capitalist friends
[21:44] are trying their best to
begin deep sea mining.
[21:47] The United Nations has an
International Seabed Authority
[21:50] which has the authority to
[21:51] grant this permission to
any country in the world.
[21:54] Although no country has received the
permission to do deep sea mining yet,
[21:58] but there's immense
pressure on this organisation.
[22:02] It's speculated that it might grant
permission to a few countries this year.
[22:05] But we need to raise our voice
[22:08] and show them the
strength of the masses.
[22:09] Many NGOs and activists have already raised
their voices against deep sea mining.
[22:13] There are about 32 countries
[22:15] to openly say that
[22:17] they won't support
deep sea mining.
[22:19] You can see the names of
these countries on the screen.
[22:21] Greenpeace has
drafted a petition
[22:23] to create pressure on
governments all across the world.
[22:26] 'Stop Deep Sea
Mining Before It Starts'
[22:29] More than 3 million people
have already signed this petition.
[22:32] I am one of them.
[22:34] And I would ask
you to sign it too.
[22:36] It is linked in the description
and pinned comment.
[22:39] As it mentions, it is a 'once
in a generation' opportunity.
[22:43] By the time we were born, fossil fuel
factories had been built everywhere.
[22:48] On land, many jungles had already
been cut down to facilitate mining.
[22:52] But this destruction hasn't
reached the deep sea yet
[22:56] and we can stop it.
[22:58] Many organisations
have come together,
[22:59] to form this Deep Sea
Conservation Coalition.
[23:02] You can go on their website
[23:04] to understand further details
[23:05] about the exact
dangers it poses.
[23:07] This is about protecting
these creatures,
[23:10] that we discussed in this video.
[23:15] As Mahatma Gandhi said,
[23:16] "The world has enough
for everyone's need,
[23:18] but not enough for
everyone's greed."
[23:20] Nature can fulfill our needs,
[23:23] but not our greed.
[23:25] That's why this fight against
greedy billionaires is crucial.
[23:32] I hope this was an
informative video.
[23:34] The link to join the AI workshop
[23:36] is in the description below.
[23:37] And the hydrothermal vents and deep
sea that we talked about in this video;
[23:42] did you know that
life began there?
[23:45] There's a significant connection between
the origin of life and the deep sea.
[23:49] If you want to know more
about how life came to be,
[23:52] I have discussed the
details in this video.
[23:55] You can click here to watch it.
[23:57] Thank you very much!
